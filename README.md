## Explaining How It Works:

- The save button is disabled until user adds into both inputs.   
- Once the user has finished their idea they can click the save button. 

- ![Add an idea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60282216/109719768-5e113a00-7b66-11eb-98c5-4b52a5f21fa3.gif)


- User can add a star to some of their favorite ideas displayed.  
- Once the user adds the star they can then click the button on the nav bar "Show Starred Ideas" to display all their favorite ideas they starred.  
- User can click "Display all ideas" button on the nav to go back to where the page shows all their ideas created.  
- User can efficently and quickly search through their ideas with the search ideas bar.  
- If the user refreshes the page they dont have to worry because the ideas will still all be there for them to see!
